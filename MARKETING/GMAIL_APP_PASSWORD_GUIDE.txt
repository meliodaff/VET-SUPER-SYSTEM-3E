HOW TO GET GMAIL APP PASSWORD - STEP BY STEP
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: App Passwords are ONLY available if 2-Step Verification is ENABLED!

================================================================================
METHOD 1: Direct Link (Easiest)
================================================================================

1. Go directly to this link:
   https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

2. If you see "App passwords aren't available for your account", you need to:
   - Enable 2-Step Verification first (see below)

================================================================================
METHOD 2: Through Security Settings
================================================================================

Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification (REQUIRED FIRST)
----------------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Look for "2-Step Verification" section
3. Click on "2-Step Verification"
4. If it says "Off", click "Get Started"
5. Follow the prompts to enable it (you'll need your phone)

Step 2: Access App Passwords
----------------------------
After 2-Step Verification is enabled:

Option A - Direct Link:
https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

Option B - Through Security Page:
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Scroll down to find "2-Step Verification" section
3. Click on "2-Step Verification" (it should show "On")
4. Scroll down on that page
5. Look for "App passwords" link (usually at the bottom)
6. Click "App passwords"

Step 3: Generate App Password
-----------------------------
1. You'll be asked to sign in again (for security)
2. Select app: Choose "Mail"
3. Select device: Choose "Other (Custom name)"
4. Enter name: Type "XAMPP" or "Local Development"
5. Click "Generate"
6. Copy the 16-character password (it looks like: abcd efgh ijkl mnop)
7. Use this password in sendmail.ini (remove the spaces)

================================================================================
METHOD 3: Alternative - Use "Less Secure App Access" (Older Method)
================================================================================

NOTE: Google has deprecated this, but if you have an older account, you might
still see this option. However, App Passwords are more secure and recommended.

If you can't find App Passwords:
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Look for "Less secure app access" (may not be visible on newer accounts)
3. Enable it (not recommended for security reasons)

   - smtp_port=587
   - smtp_ssl=tls

2. Use Yahoo Mail SMTP:
